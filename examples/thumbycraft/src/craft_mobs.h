/*
 * ThumbyCraft — passive mobs (Phase 27).
 *
 * Up to CRAFT_MAX_MOBS billboarded sprites with simple wandering AI.
 * Three types ship in v1: sheep, pig, chicken. All walk a slow random
 * walk on the ground, snap to terrain via gravity, and don't collide
 * with each other (overkill for this scale).
 *
 * Rendering is a billboard sprite pass that runs once per frame after
 * the world raycaster. Z-test against craft_zbuf so mobs occlude
 * correctly behind trees and hills.
