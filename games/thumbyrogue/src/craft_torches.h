/*
 * ThumbyCraft — 3D torch rendering + orientation tracking.
 *
 * Torches occupy a world cell (for lighting + collision) but don't
 * render as a full cube. The raycaster treats BLK_TORCH cells as
 * transparent (rays pass through). After the world render, this
 * module draws each torch in the window as 2 small cuboids — a
 * thin stick + a flame block — offset to match how the torch was
 * mounted (top of the block below for floor torches, sticking out
 * of the wall for wall torches).
 *
 * Orientation is captured at placement time and stored in a small
 * sparse hash keyed on world coords (same trick as the mod table).
 * Rebuilt-on-window-shift, mirroring craft_world_lightmap.
