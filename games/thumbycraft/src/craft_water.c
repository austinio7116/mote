/*
 * ThumbyCraft — water flow simulation (impl).
 *
 * One tick every WATER_TICK_PERIOD seconds. Per tick:
 *   1. Scan window for water cells (BLK_WATER, any level).
 *   2. For each: queue propagation events into adjacent air cells.
 *   3. For each non-source flowing cell with no neighbour at a
 *      lower level: queue a decay event.
 *   4. Apply queued events at end of tick.
 *
 * The queue is bounded so a single tick can never spend more than
 * WATER_EVENT_MAX writes; remaining changes are picked up next
 * tick (the simulation converges over a few ticks regardless).
