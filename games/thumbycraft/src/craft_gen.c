/* --- Buildings ---------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Eight building designs spawn deterministically in flat lowland
 * tiles. A building "exists" at column (hx, hz) iff hut_origin_at
 * returns true; per-type W, H and top-dy come from hut_w / hut_h /
 * hut_top so each design uses only the footprint it actually needs.
 *
 * The world-scan code uses HUT_W=HUT_H=7 as the max bounding-box
 * dimensions; smaller designs return AIR for cells outside their own
 * W×H footprint. HUT_TOP_DY=7 accommodates the tallest design
 * (watchtower / church steeple). Generation is deterministic per
 * (hx, hz, seed) and must be applied identically in
 * craft_gen_block_at and craft_gen_column — the save diff layer
 * relies on per-cell agreement.
