/*
 * ThumbyCraft — dropped item entities.
 *
 * Small pool of "item floating in the world" entities. A drop has a
 * world position, a block / item id, a lifetime, and a small Y bob
 * so it stays visually distinct from the terrain.
 *
 * Sources:
 *   - Mob death (skeleton → bow + arrows)
 *   - Arrow miss recovery (an arrow that hits a block or expires
 *     becomes a collectable arrow drop)
 *   - Future: more mob loot, broken-block items if we add the "drop
 *     what you mined" feature
 *
 * Pickup: any drop within CRAFT_DROP_PICKUP_DIST of the player gets
 * collected into their inventory[blk_id] and despawns.
 *
 * Rendering: each drop renders as a small spinning cube using the
 * existing block atlas — cheap to project, just one cuboid per drop.
